# Solver Package v1: Specification

English | [Português](PACKAGE_SPEC.pt-BR.md)

Status: **approved by the owner on 2026-09-30** (D1-D14 confirmed; review within 5 business days). Reviewed in two rounds by independent reviewers (consistency with the code; security, operations and product). **Implemented on 2026-10-02 on the `feat/criador-solvers` branch (committed, not deployed yet): P0 to P4, P5 partial (only the honest rating labels) and P8** (see §22 and the "Implementation deviations" block). **P6** (pre-opening) and **P7** (Opening) remain pending. Operational guide: `docs/creator-guide.md`.
Scope: package format, validation, submission, manual review, publication, delivery to the user and the "Solver Builder".
Basis: the current code (`apps/server/src/runtime/*`, `mcp/*`, `knowledge/*`, `memory/*`, `cli/publish.ts`, the Tempo contracts in `contracts/src`) and `docs/architecture.md`.

Language: packages are **English-primary** (manifest, steps, knowledge, templates and evals are written in English) and can optionally ship a Portuguese (pt-BR) translation of the storefront text in `locales/pt.json`. The five step-section titles are in English too (§5.1; the old Portuguese titles are still accepted for older packages). One thing stays in Portuguese today because the code still expects it: the manifest `category` values (§4.1). This document describes it as it is.

Legend: **[exists]** already works and stays; **[changes]** exists and changes; **[new]** does not exist. Phase: **[Core]** ships in the first delivery (invite-only curation); **[Opening]** only ships before accepting unknown creators (§2).

## 0. Read this first

### 0.1 Summary

1. A **Solver** is a folder (delivered as a ZIP) with a manifest, steps, knowledge, templates and evals. The server never hands over the folder: it delivers **one step at a time**, searches the knowledge, stores memory and (in the Opening phase) runs tools. The user uses their own Claude or ChatGPT through an MCP connector.
2. What sets it apart from a plain skill is what only exists on the server: **an executable tool, a result verifier, live data, memory and human escalation**. The manifest declares which of these it has (§4.2) and the reviewer checks.
3. First **invite-only curation** (Core): creators you know upload ZIPs through the site and you review by hand. Only after a security, legal and economics checklist (§2.2) does it open to strangers (Opening).
4. The **Solver Builder** is a free platform Solver that guides the assembly of the package, consults the server's validator and hands over the ZIP (§19).
5. In the Core phase, knowledge is `.md`/`.txt` (the user's own AI converts PDFs locally, at no cost to us). PDF, HTML and CSV arrive in the Opening phase, with isolated reading.
6. "Adapting to the user" is a **calibration** on first use plus **notes** saved when the user asks, both in encrypted memory.
7. Whoever registers the Solver on-chain (the `SolversRegistry` contract on Tempo) is **the creator**, who co-signs on the site (§15). The platform does not hold third-party keys. The **final on-chain approval** of every new Solver is signed by you, with the cold wallet, off the VPS.
8. Every new version goes through the full manual review, with a diff of all files.
9. The 8 current packages (folders in `agents/`; 6 published and 2 unpublished) keep working unchanged (§18).

### 0.2 Decisions (confirmed on 2026-09-30)

D5 (shared VPS infrastructure), D9 (review in **5 business days**), D10, D12 and D13 were answered explicitly; the others held by the recommended default, with no objection. Editing shared infrastructure (D5) only happens in P4, with the VPS in view.

| # | Decision | Default applied | If you disagree |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Open uploads to anyone or start by invite? | **Invite** (a code sent by email, bound to the wallet on first login; D14), opening only after §2.2 | Changes §2, §14 and phase P4 |
| D2 | Who signs the on-chain registration of third-party creators? | **The creator co-signs** on the site; the platform relay is the fee payer. It is the only viable route: `registerAgent` and `updateVersion` require the creator's signature (`NotCreator` otherwise), and the server does not hold the key (§15) | Custody of third-party keys, which the code blocks on mainnet |
| D3 | A free platform Solver (the Builder)? | **Database only**, no on-chain registration (the Registry's `minPrice` is 5 USD-stablecoin units and applies to the whole marketplace) | Zeroing `minPrice` removes the floor for everyone |
| D4 | Third-party creators' performance rating on the storefront? | **No** in the Core phase. Buyer reviews only. The on-chain rating only for platform packages | Requires the platform to generate the eval answers (§12) |
| D5 | Where do ZIPs and published packages live? | `/var/www/solvers/shared/{submissions,packages}`: inside `/var/www/<project>` (the VPS guide's convention), in the `shared/` folder that `deploy.sh` already uses for what survives between releases. **Requires editing shared VPS infrastructure**: `/opt/deploy/backup.sh` (backup) and the global `nginx.conf` (the upload `limit_req` zone). I need your authorization for each | Without this there is no backup of third-party packages |
| D6 | Calibration and memory notes included from the start? | **Yes** (Core), with the adjustments in §10 and §11 | |
| D7 | Before opening to strangers: removal and refund policy, terms with data clauses, legal review, and economics against a bad creator (deposit above zero or withholding the payout for N days) | **Prerequisites of the Opening phase**, not open questions (§2.2) | |
| D8 | Core caps | ZIP 50 MB, 10,000 chunks, file 10 MB, `.md`/`.txt` only (§3.2). Larger caps only after a benchmark in the Opening phase | |
| D9 | Who reviews? | **You**, 100% of versions, with a full diff and a 5-business-day target. Confirm you have the time, or say who else can review (the queue accepts more than one admin in `ADMIN_WALLETS`) | Defines Core capacity |
| D10 | Final on-chain approval | For **every new Solver**, you sign `approveAgent` with the cold wallet (`cli:approve`; the platform relay pays the fee, so the cold wallet holds no tokens). Version updates do not need that signature | Keeping the key on the VPS defeats the purpose of the cold wallet |
| D11 | Guarantee in production | The VPS environment keeps `GUARANTEE_MIN_SALES=0` (the `frontend-react` guarantee demo depends on it). Third parties do not offer a guarantee: the **validator rejects it** (`MANIFEST_GUARANTEE_FORBIDDEN`). The real values return before the Opening phase (§2.2) | Turning the rule on now switches off the demo guarantee |
| D12 | Which network does the Core open on? | The Tempo testnet **Moderato** first (faucet stablecoins). The co-signing flow (§15.2) already serves mainnet; the creator keys that `cli:publish` generates for platform packages are refused on mainnet and must not be used for third parties | On mainnet, real money starts being paid to creators (see D13) |
| D13 | Categories and consumer risk in the Core phase | Allowed: `Desenvolvimento` (Development), `Design`, `Dia a dia` (Everyday), `Negócios` (Business), `Viagens` (Travel), `Conteúdo` (Content), `Escrita` (Writing), `Outros` (Other). **Not** for third parties in the Core phase: `Finanças` (Finance), `Jurídico` (Legal) and health. Tax or regulatory content within the allowed ones needs a disclaimer in the text (the reviewer checks). A purchase pays the creator immediately and there is no refund: the risk is accepted while it is testnet/invite-only | Releasing the regulated categories before legal review exposes you |
| D14 | How to invite | **An invite code sent by email** (table `creator_invites`); the wallet is bound on first login. You do not need to know anyone's address | Inviting by wallet address requires the creator to send it first |

### 0.3 Glossary

* **RAG / knowledge**: the creator's texts cut into pieces (*chunks*), indexed by meaning; the AI queries them through the `search_knowledge` tool.
* **Step and gate**: step = a step of the method; *gate* = a checklist the AI must satisfy to move on.
* **Runner**: the "executor" of a tool on the server.
* **Front matter**: a metadata header at the top of a `.md` file (between `---`).
* **egress**: user data leaving our server for a creator's service.
* **SSRF**: making the server call internal addresses it should not.
* **Fee payer**: whoever pays the network fee of a Tempo transaction (type `0x76`); here, the platform's RELAY key (the user needs no tokens for fees).
* **`scoreBps`**: a rating in basis points (8750 = 87.5%). **`versionHash`**: the package's fingerprint, stored on-chain.
* **Staging**: a test area for the submitted package before approval.
* **MCP**: the protocol through which the user's Claude/ChatGPT talks to our server (the "connector").
* **On-chain / co-sign**: written by the Solvers contracts on Tempo; "co-sign" = the creator signs one batched transaction in their wallet, and the platform relay pays the fee.
* **Kill switch**: shutting a Solver down instantly (it stops answering, including for those who already bought).
* **PM2**: the VPS process manager; **ZIP**: the compressed file in which the creator delivers the package.
* **Cold wallet**: a key kept off the server (here, the on-chain admin's).

## 1. Principles

1. **The value stays on the server.** If you can copy everything into a folder and paste it into the chat, it is a skill.
2. **The validator is the format.** The schema lives in code (zod). Documentation, the Builder and the CLI consume the same validator; none reimplements validation. The text of this spec that the Builder carries in its knowledge is there to explain; the one that decides whether a package is valid is always the validator.
3. **Early, actionable errors.** Every error has a code, a path and how to fix it (Appendix A).
4. **Honesty about what is measured.** No rating is shown or written on-chain without its method being stated and without the platform having produced it (§12).
5. **Third-party content is untrusted.** Everything the creator writes reaches the user's model and may try to instruct it against the user. This guides review, scanning and scope (§17).
6. **Minimal personal data.** What is on the user's computer stays there; only what passes through the MCP tools reaches the server (§17 (item 2)).
7. **Authority on the server, not in the manifest.** Fields such as `platform`, `specVersion` and internal runners only take effect if the server agrees.
8. **The smallest scope that proves the differentiator.** What is risky (third-party code, heavy parsers, LLM-based ratings) is left until after the Opening phase.

---

## 2. Two opening phases

### 2.1 What goes into each

| Capability | Core (invite) | Opening (strangers) |
|---|---|---|
| Who submits | Invited creators (code, D14) | Any signed-in user with a complete profile |
| Knowledge formats | `.md`, `.txt` | + `.pdf`, `.html`, `.csv`, read in an isolated process (§6.1) |
| Templates | `.md`, `.txt`, `.json` | + sanitized images, `.csv` with formula protection |
| Tools | `builtin` only (platform). Third-party creators: none | + `http` (§8), then `mcp` |
| Gates | Text | + with evidence (§5.2) |
| Calibration and memory notes | Yes (§10, §11) | Yes |
| Public performance rating | Platform packages only | Third parties: only a rating produced by the platform (§12) |
| Guarantee (escrow) | Platform packages only | Third parties, after their own rules (§9) |
| Review | Manual, 100% of versions | Manual; queue with limits and an entry fee |
| Caps | ZIP 50 MB, 10,000 chunks, file 10 MB | Defined after a benchmark (§16) |

### 2.2 Mandatory checklist to open (Opening)

Nothing in the "Opening" column is released to strangers before everything below is done:

1. **Legal**: creator terms with data-handling and copyright clauses; a reporting, takedown and deadline policy; privacy texts; review by a lawyer. The Finance, Legal and Health categories only for verified creators and with a mandatory disclaimer (§17 (item 6)).
2. **Economics**: a rule against a bad creator. Today the deposit is 0, so slashing (`proposeSlash` -> 72 h -> `executeSlash`) has nothing to confiscate, and a license purchase pays the creator immediately, with no refund. The path that does not change the contracts is to require a deposit above zero (`minStake`, Registry configuration only); withholding the payout for N days would require a contract upgrade.
3. **Kill switch tested** (§15.4): suspending drops open sessions and blocks sales, including direct on-chain ones.
4. **Production aligned**: `GUARANTEE_MIN_SALES` and `GUARANTEE_MIN_RATING` with the rule's values in the real environment (the demo uses 0; D11). Changing `infra/setup-vps.sh` is not enough: the production `.env` has to be adjusted.
5. **Measured capacity** (an ingestion benchmark and a separate process, §16) and an **upload security test**. The `http` security test is a prerequisite for turning `http` on, not for opening.
6. **Creator dashboard** (profile, verified contact, secrets, payouts, tickets) and **buyer support** defined.
7. **Free trial per person** (Privy's verified email; implemented: wallets linked to the same verified email share one trial, `apps/server/src/auth/person.ts`): a per-wallet trial is disposable.

These items are distributed across the phases of §22 (P4, P6) and the checkpoint.

## 3. Package structure (ZIP)

### 3.1 Tree

```
<slug>/                      # single root folder inside the ZIP
├─ manifest.json             # [exists, changes] required
├─ steps/                    # [exists] 1 to 12 .md files
├─ knowledge/                # [exists, changes] optional: .md .txt in free subfolders
├─ templates/                # [exists, changes] optional: actually delivered (§7)
├─ locales/
│  └─ pt.json                # [new] optional: Portuguese (pt-BR) storefront text only (name, tagline, description, packageContents, requirements, searchPhrases, creatorBio)
├─ evals/
│  ├─ cases/*.json           # [exists, changes] 10 to 40 cases
│  ├─ outputs/*.md + meta.json   # [exists] answers generated by the creator ("checks" method, §12)
│  └─ report.json            # [exists, changes] optional on submission; the platform generates the official one
├─ verifier/                 # [exists] platform packages ONLY
└─ README.md                 # [new] optional: a note to the reviewer (does not go to the user)
```

### 3.2 ZIP rules (envelope) **[Core]**

Core values; the Opening ones come out of the benchmark (§16).

| Rule | Value | Code |
|---|---|---|
| ZIP size | up to 50 MB | `ZIP_TOO_LARGE` |
| Actual uncompressed bytes | up to 150 MB, **counted during streaming extraction** (aborts on overflow; does not trust the header) | `ZIP_EXPANDS_TOO_MUCH` |
| Number of files | up to 2,000 | `ZIP_TOO_MANY_FILES` |
| Root | exactly 1 folder with `manifest.json` | `ZIP_BAD_ROOT` |
| Entry names | unique (NFC comparison, case-insensitive); validation and extraction use the ZIP's **central directory** | `ZIP_DUPLICATE_ENTRY` |
| Paths | relative, no `..`, no `\`, no control characters, no name starting with `.`, NFC-normalized; allowed: Unicode letters and digits, `.` `_` `-` space and `/` | `ZIP_BAD_PATH` |
| System junk | `__MACOSX/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` are **removed from extraction with a warning** (they do not reject the ZIP: whoever compresses in Finder creates them by accident) | `ZIP_IGNORED_FILE` (warning) |
| Symbolic links | rejected (Unix mode in the header); extraction does not follow links | `ZIP_SYMLINK` |
| Extensions | `.json .md .txt` | `FILE_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED` |
| Text | valid UTF-8 | `FILE_NOT_UTF8` |
| Single file | up to 10 MB | `FILE_TOO_LARGE` |
| Knowledge chunks | up to 10,000 per package | `KNOWLEDGE_TOO_BIG` |

Extraction runs in an isolated folder, without execute permission, without network, and nothing in the ZIP is executed.

The size limit exists because of the **server**: ingestion uses the CPU and disk of a shared VPS (2 vCPU, 7.8 GB RAM, 97 GB disk). Larger knowledge bases enter in the Opening phase, after the benchmark.

### 3.3 References inside the manifest **[new, Core]**

Every path written in the manifest (`steps[].file`, `templates[].path`) must: be relative and normalized; start with `steps/` or `templates/`; exist in the ZIP; stay, once resolved (`realpath`), inside the package folder; and not be a symbolic link. `slug` and `version` are validated by regular expression **before** they enter any disk path. This also applies to the server's loader, which today reads `join(dir, s.file)` without checking (`runtime/packages.ts:57`); that fix is in P0 (§22).

### 3.4 Hash **[exists]**

`packageHash` (a deterministic sha256 of path and content, CRLF normalized in text extensions, without `evals/report.json`) stays the same and remains the on-chain `versionHash` (`bytes32` in the Registry). The hash is computed **once**, at approval, over the published folder, and stored in the database; the server does not recompute it on every load. `locales/pt.json` is part of the hash like any other file.

### 3.5 Localization (`locales/`) **[new, Core]**

Packages are written in **English**: `manifest.json`, steps, knowledge base and templates. The only part of a package that is localized is the storefront text, through an optional `locales/pt.json` (Portuguese, pt-BR). Only `pt` is accepted for now; any other file under `locales/` is rejected with `FILE_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED`.

```json
{
  "name": "Fechamento do MEI",
  "tagline": "Feche o mês do seu MEI sem erro",
  "description": "Conduz a IA por um fechamento mensal do MEI…",
  "packageContents": ["Método em 3 etapas", "Base com DAS e limites do ano", "Modelo de relatório mensal"],
  "requirements": [{ "key": "any", "label": "Claude ou ChatGPT" }],
  "searchPhrases": ["fechar o mês do MEI", "quanto pago de DAS"],
  "creatorBio": "Contadores que atendem MEI há 10 anos"
}
```

| Field | Required | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `name`, `tagline`, `description` | yes | non-empty; up to 80, 200 and 3,000 characters (the 32-byte name limit applies to the manifest name only) |
| `packageContents` | yes | 1 to 12 items, each up to 300 characters; replaces the manifest list as a whole |
| `requirements` | no | `{ key, label }` items; `key` must exist in the manifest `requirements` and appear once; only the `label` is replaced (type, `optional`, `howTo` and `helpUrl` stay as in the manifest) |
| `searchPhrases` | no | up to 20 phrases of 3 to 120 characters; indexed as extra search vectors, so Portuguese queries find the Solver |
| `creatorBio` | no | up to 1,000 characters; shown on the creator profile when the site is in Portuguese |

The schema is strict (an unknown field is `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN_FIELD`; a wrong type or size is `MANIFEST_SCHEMA`, with the field in `path`, e.g. `locales/pt.json#tagline`), and every text goes through the same hidden-character and injection scans as the manifest.

How the catalog serves it:

- `agents.translations` (jsonb, `{}` by default) stores the parsed file when the package is published.
- Catalog endpoints take `?lang=pt|en`; without it they follow the `Accept-Language` header, and the default is English. With `lang=pt` the translated `name`, `tagline`, `description` and `packageContents` replace the manifest ones, requirement labels are replaced by `key`, and anything the file does not cover stays in English. A package without `locales/pt.json` is served in English in every language.
- The MCP connector always speaks English.
- Steps, knowledge, templates and tools are **not** localized: whatever language they are written in is the one the AI works in.

## 4. Manifest (`manifest.json`)

### 4.1 Field reference

`specVersion: 1` activates the new rules. Unknown fields: in third-party submissions (`specVersion: 1`) they are an **error** `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN_FIELD`; the current zod silently strips them in platform packages (v0).

| Field | Type and rule | Default | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `specVersion` | `1`. In third-party submissions the server requires `1` | v0 if absent (platform packages only) | Core | new |
| `id` | 32 lowercase hex characters. **Absent in the 1st version**: the server assigns it and binds it to the creator's wallet. In later versions it is required and must belong to the signed-in creator | server assigns | Core | changes |
| `slug` | `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, 3-40, and **must not look like an `id`** (32 hex: `MANIFEST_SLUG_LOOKS_LIKE_ID`). `id` and `slug` form a single namespace in the duplicate check. A list of reserved slugs (brands and platform); only the owner of the `id` reuses one. The server now indexes `id` and `slug` in separate maps (today they share the same `Map` and `findAgentRow` does `id = x OR slug = x` with no ordering) | — | Core | changes |
| `name` | 3-32 UTF-8 **bytes** (validator rule `MANIFEST_NAME_TOO_LONG`; the contracts do not store the name) | — | Core | changes |
| `tagline` | 10-100 characters | — | Core | changes |
| `description` | 120-2,000 characters: what it delivers, for whom, what it does **not** do | — | Core | exists |
| `category` | `Desenvolvimento` (Development), `Design`, `Dia a dia` (Everyday), `Negócios` (Business), `Jurídico` (Legal), `Finanças` (Finance), `Viagens` (Travel), `Conteúdo` (Content), `Escrita` (Writing), `Outros` (Other) (list in the config; the stored value is the Portuguese identifier). Third parties in the Core phase: only those allowed in D13 (`MANIFEST_CATEGORY_FORBIDDEN`); `Finanças` and `Jurídico` wait for the Opening phase | — | Core | changes |
| `version` | numeric `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, no pre-release, up to 16 **bytes** (`MAX_VERSION_LEN` in `contracts/src/SolversTypes.sol`); greater than the published one | — | Core | changes |
| `creator` | `{ id, name, bio, avatarUrl? }`. On submission, the server overwrites `id` with the creator's profile identifier (`creators.id`, text generated at sign-up) | — | Core | changes |
| `requirements[]` | `{ type: client/connector/plan, label (required), key?, optional?, howTo? (<=600), helpUrl? (https, on an allowlist) }` | `[]` | Core | exists |
| `packageContents[]` | 3-8 items; the validator checks them against reality (`CONTENTS_MISMATCH`) | — | Core | changes |
| `searchPhrases[]` | up to 20 of 3-120; the reviewer checks them against the real content (search manipulation) | `[]` | Core | exists |
| `beforeAfter[]` | up to 5 | `[]` | Core | exists |
| `versions[]` | changelog; **mandatory** one entry for the current `version` | `[]` | Core | changes |
| `terms` | `{ rightsConfirmed: true, sourcesListed: true }` | — | Core | new |
| `platform` | `true` only in a platform package. In third-party submissions the server rejects it. The authority is a server list (`PLATFORM_AGENTS`: slug and `id`), not this field | `false` | Core | new |
| `usesMemory` | `true` if it uses `get_memory`/`save_memory`; if absent, deduced from the steps. Must be `true` with `onboarding` | deduction | Core | exists |
| `steps[]` | 1-12; `{ file, title?, gate[] }`; `gate`: 0-6 items (text; an object with `evidence` in the Opening phase, §5.2) | — | Core | exists |
| `knowledge` | `{ updatedAt, reviewEveryDays, sources[] }` | — | Core | new |
| `templates[]` | `{ name, path, title, description }` (§7) | `[]` | Core | new |
| `tools[]` | Core: platform package only. Third parties: Opening (§8) | `[]` | Core/Opening | changes |
| `onboarding` | `{ questions[1..5] }` (§10) | — | Core | new |
| `escalation` | `{ enabled: boolean }`. The creator's contact comes from their profile, not from the ZIP | `{enabled:false}` | Core | new |
| `differentiators[]` | a subset of `tool`, `verifier`, `liveData`, `memory`, `escalation` (§4.2) | `[]` | Core | new |
| `guarantee` | as today. Third parties: `available: true` is an **error** in the Core phase (`MANIFEST_GUARANTEE_FORBIDDEN`, §9) | `{available:false}` | Core | exists |
| `pricing` | `{ priceUsdc, royaltyBps }`. `priceUsdc` is the price in **USD-stablecoin units** (the field keeps its historical name; the payment token is a TIP-20 USD stablecoin with 6 decimals) and must be >= the Registry's `minPrice` (5 today). `royaltyBps` (validator: 0-1,000) is the **creator share of the transfer royalty**, in bps of the license's ORIGINAL price: whoever transfers a license pays it on-chain, plus the platform share (a Registry setting, 500 by default); both together are capped at 2,500 bps (`RoyaltyTooHigh`). It is fixed at registration and can only be changed (`setRoyaltyBps`) before the first sale (`RoyaltyLocked` afterwards) | — | Core | exists |
| `supply` | `{ maxLicenses }`: an integer from 1 to 1,000,000; the cap on licenses sold. The CURRENT limit is enforced and verifiable on-chain (the Registry's `setSupplyCap`; a license purchase fails with `SoldOut`) and counts licenses issued over the solver's lifetime (`totalSales`): transferring or burning does not reopen a slot. The contract only prevents **lowering** the cap (`SupplyCapCannotDecrease`): the creator can raise it later (up to unlimited) and a solver created with no cap is unlimited, so the promise to the buyer is "the limit today is N and it can only go up", never "only N will exist". `cli:publish` creates the cap and only **raises** it (a `maxLicenses` lower than the on-chain value is ignored with a warning). Independent of `trial` | unlimited | Core | new |
| `trial` | as today (`available`, `uses`, `steps`, `searches`, `tools`, `summary`, `lockedSummary`), plus `templates[]` (names unlocked in the trial; default none). Independent of `supply`: the trial does not consume a slot | no trial | Core | exists/changes |
| `catalogOnly` | removed from v1 (it has no effect in the code); warning `CATALOG_ONLY_IGNORED` | — | — | changes |

### 4.2 Declared differentiators **[Core]**

| Value | What the creator declares | How the validator checks (warning) |
|---|---|---|
| `tool` | An executable tool on the server | `tools.length >= 1` and each one is used in some step |
| `verifier` | A result verified automatically | A test-based guarantee (platform only) |
| `liveData` | Live data: dated and maintained knowledge, or a tool that queries an external source | `knowledge.updatedAt` within `reviewEveryDays`, **no** file with an expired `valid_until` and >= 50% with `source_date`; or an `http` tool (Opening) |
| `memory` | Adapts to the user | `onboarding` present **and** at least one step uses the profile (the step text mentions the profile); the reviewer checks |
| `escalation` | The creator handles complex cases | `escalation.enabled` **and** a **verified** contact channel (Telegram linking by code, §14.1), without falling back to the platform admin's chat; `escalate_to_creator` now respects `enabled` (today it ignores it) |

**"2 of 5" criterion**: the reviewer only approves with at least 2 **proven** differentiators (the right-hand column is what they check, not just the presence of the field); the storefront shows which ones. It is a review and badge criterion, not an automatic validator block.

**Honesty about the Core phase**: third parties have neither `tool` nor `verifier` (the two differentiators that most distinguish a Solver from a skill), which only arrive in the Opening phase. In the Core phase, the third-party product is **guided process + live, cited knowledge + memory + creator support**. That already beats an ordinary skill, but it is less than the full promise, and the storefront must not promise a tool or verification on these packages.

### 4.3 Limits that come from the contracts

`version` <= 16 bytes (`MAX_VERSION_LEN`) and the metadata URI <= 200 bytes (`MAX_URI_LEN`) come from the contracts (`contracts/src/SolversTypes.sol`). `name` <= 32 bytes is kept as a validator rule (the old on-chain limit; the Registry no longer stores the name). The current packages go through a validator report in P1; exceptions (for example, a 93-character `tagline` in `revisao-contratos`, the "Escrita" category in `copy-marketing`) are covered by the limits above.

## 5. Steps

### 5.1 Structure **[changes]**

Written **for the AI**, in the second person, directly. Sections with these titles:

```
# Step N: <title>
## Goal
## What to ask the user
## How to run
## Common mistakes
## result_summary format
```

The validator looks for these five English section titles exactly as written; the text under them can be in any language. For older packages it still accepts the previous Portuguese titles, one for one: `## Objetivo`, `## O que perguntar ao usuário`, `## Como executar`, `## Erros comuns`, `## Formato do result_summary`. New packages should use the English ones. A missing section is a **warning** in v0 and an **error** in v1 for `Goal`, `How to run` and `result_summary format`. Size: 400 to 12,000 characters.

Content rules (an automatic scan for the reviewer, who decides):

* `STEP_REFERENCE_UNKNOWN`: a name in backticks matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` and the manifest's tool-name pattern must exist in `tools[]`; the names of the MCP's global tools (`search_knowledge`, `save_memory`, etc.) and of connectors (Figma etc.) are exempt.
* No instruction to reveal the content of the steps; no request for passwords, national ID numbers, cards or credentials (`STEP_SENSITIVE_ASK`); no URLs for sending data to third parties (`STEP_EXTERNAL_URL`); no injection patterns (`STEP_INJECTION_PATTERN`); no invisible or bidirectional Unicode (`TEXT_HIDDEN_CHARS`).
* The same scans apply to **all manifest text that reaches the model** (`tagline`, `description`, `trial.summary`, `lockedSummary`, `howTo`, `searchPhrases`, `beforeAfter`, tool descriptions) and to the text of the calibration questions.

### 5.2 Gates with evidence **[Opening]**

* **Text** gate: as today; the server does not check it.
* **Evidence** gate: `{ "text": "Tests passing", "evidence": { "tool": "run_tests" } }`. A single format: `tool` only. To advance, `next_step` checks in `tool_runs` whether the tool ran **in the session's current step** with `ok = true` and, if the tool has a `passField` (`builtin` only, which returns `passed: boolean`), with `passed = true`.
* New table `tool_runs(id, session_id, agent_id, step_index, tool, ok, passed, response_hash, created_at)`, written **inside** `run_tool` (including on error). `usage_events` is **not** suitable: it only stores a generic `tool = "run_tool"`, has no step or result, is only written when the handler returns, and feeds the on-chain batches.
* **Failures**: an execution error (runner, timeout, HTTP 5xx) refunds the trial balance; a negative result (`ok: true, passed: false`) consumes it. After 3 consecutive execution errors in the same step, the gate is waived with a warning (`evidence_waived`) and escalation is offered.
* For an `http` tool, the evidence is **attested by the creator's service** and only `ok` counts (the storefront does not present it as independent proof).

Evidence is a verifiable minimum: the server knows the tool ran, not that the work is good.

## 6. Knowledge (RAG)

### 6.1 Formats

| Format | Core | Opening |
|---|---|---|
| `.md` | Yes [exists] | Yes |
| `.txt` | **Yes [changes]**: today only `.md` is read (`ingest.ts:18`); `.txt` becomes a single section | Yes |
| `.html` | No (convert to `.md` first) | Yes: `parse5`/`htmlparser2` (no `jsdom` with resources, no browser); strips `<script>`, `<style>`, comments and hidden text (`display:none`, font size 0, color equal to the background) and **flags** it to the reviewer |
| `.csv` | No | Yes: each row becomes "column: value"; blocks of up to 2,000 characters with the header repeated |
| `.pdf` | No (convert to `.md`) | Yes: per-page text extraction **in a child process**, no network, with `ulimit` and a timeout, a page limit; a PDF with no text is rejected (`PDF_NO_TEXT`); the scan looks at the **extracted text** (including invisible text) |

**How the creator converts PDFs in the Core phase**: the Solver Builder guides the conversion in the user's own AI, which reads the PDF locally and writes the `.md` files with the metadata. It costs the server nothing and the reviewer reads the same text that will be indexed.

Chunking [exists]: by `#` to `###` headings; sections above 2,000 characters split by paragraph; 200 characters of overlap with the heading repeated. Model: `multilingual-e5-small`, 384 dimensions, HNSW index. Search uses the vector; full-text is a fallback.

### 6.2 Metadata **[new, Core]**

YAML front matter at the top of the `.md`:

```yaml
---
title: Revolving credit card debt and overdraft
source: Central Bank of Brazil, CMN Resolution 4,549
source_url: https://www.bcb.gov.br/...
source_date: 2026-09-01
valid_until: 2026-12-31
tags: [interest, credit-card]
---
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `title` | optional; default = first heading |
| `source` | required in v1 |
| `source_url` | optional, `https` |
| `source_date` | `YYYY-MM-DD`; required for `liveData` |
| `valid_until` | `YYYY-MM-DD`, optional |
| `tags` | up to 10 |

`.txt` files use `name.txt.meta.json` with the same fields. The current packages (v0) have **no** front matter; they remain valid and are not required to have it.

### 6.3 Search **[changes]**

`search_knowledge` now returns per chunk: the text, the source (title and `source`), the date and, if `valid_until` has passed, the warning "may be out of date (valid until DD/MM/YYYY)". The model is instructed to cite the source. Still at most 5 chunks, with a watermark. Filtering by `tags` later. Reranking and hybrid search are **out of v1**.

This covers exactly the case we already have (e.g. Desenrola, a Brazilian debt-renegotiation program that expires on 10/26).

### 6.4 Table **[changes]**

`knowledge_chunks` gains `meta jsonb` and `valid_until date`. The key stays `(agent_id, version)`; the test ingestion (staging) uses the version `staging:<submission_id>` and, at approval, the chunks are **renamed** to the real version (a single `UPDATE`, no vector recomputation).

### 6.5 Content protection

Knowledge never leaves as a file, only as chunks. Real limits and limitations:

1. **Watermark**: today it is one of **8 phrases** chosen by the wallet's hash (`engine.ts`). That gives 3 bits: it serves as a **hint**, not as proof or individual tracing. This document does not promise "tracing".
2. **Daily `search_knowledge` quota per license** [new, Core]: an initial value of 300 per day, configurable; above that, the response is "daily limit reached". Without it, a 5-to-9-USD license allows sweeping the whole base within hours (the current rate of 60 calls per minute does not limit the total). Even with the quota, a base of 10,000 chunks at 5 chunks per search is swept in about a week: the quota makes copying more expensive, it does not prevent it.
3. **Sweep detection** (nearly identical queries, many distinct chunks per day) raises an alert to the admin.
4. **Free trial**: serves only files marked `trial: true` in the front matter (default: none); beyond that, the `trial.searches` balance applies.
5. **Accepted limitation**: the content the AI must read to work can be copied by the license-owning user. The product protects itself through continuous updates and what only runs on the server, not through absolute secrecy.

---

## 7. Templates **[changes]**

Today the folder exists, but the server does not deliver the files.

* `manifest.templates[]` declares the name, path, title and description. What is not declared is not delivered.
* A new global MCP tool **`get_template`** `{ session_id, name }` returns the content (text) under the same session access control and with a watermark. The `activate_solver` `overview` lists the available templates. In the free trial, only `trial.templates`.
* Types in the Core phase: `.md`, `.txt`, `.json`. Images, PDFs and spreadsheets (Opening) are only downloaded through the site, with `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `nosniff` and a `sandbox` CSP; `.svg` and `.html` are blocked (XSS); `.csv` goes through formula protection (a prefix on cells starting with `= + - @`).
* Templates **are deliverables by definition**: there is no copy protection.

---

## 8. Tools

### 8.1 Runner types

| `runner` | Who | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `builtin:<name>` | Platform packages only: `docker-react-test`, `a11y`, `contrast`, `budget`, `validate-package` (the old names `docker:solvers-react-test`, `node:*` remain as aliases, **only for platform packages**) | Core | exists/changes |
| `http` | Third parties | **Opening** | new |
| `mcp` | Third parties | Opening, second delivery | new |
| `container` | Reserved | out of v1 | |

A third-party submission **rejects** `builtin:*`, the old aliases and `platform`. A third party with the Docker runner would monopolize the verifier's global serial queue.

### 8.2 All tools

`tools[].inputSchema` (JSON Schema) is required in v1. Validation uses `ajv` **without remote `$ref`**, with `pattern` disabled (or RE2), and a maximum size and depth (avoids ReDoS in Node's single process).

### 8.3 The `http` runner **[Opening]**

```jsonc
{
  "name": "check_visa",
  "description": "Looks up the visa rule by nationality and destination",
  "runner": "http",
  "http": { "method": "POST", "url": "https://api.example.com/visa", "allowedHosts": ["api.example.com"],
            "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {{secret.API_KEY}}" }, "timeoutMs": 10000 },
  "secrets": ["API_KEY"],
  "inputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "destination": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 60 } }, "required": ["destination"], "additionalProperties": false },
  "outputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "rule": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 400 } }, "required": ["rule"] },
  "egress": true
}
```

Requirements (all mandatory before release):

1. **SSRF**: connect through an `undici.Agent` with a `connect.lookup` that validates the **IP of the effective connection** (no re-resolving afterwards). Only `https`, only port 443. Block: loopback, `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `169.254/16`, `100.64/10` (includes this VPS's Tailscale network), `0.0.0.0/8`, multicast, IPv6 `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`, IPv4-mapped (`::ffff:`), NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`) and 6to4 (`2002::/16`). Redirects only to a host in `allowedHosts`, over `https`, at most 2. Prefer a helper process with its own UID and a firewall rule that only allows the public internet.
2. **Restricted input**: only `enum`, numbers and strings with `maxLength` <= 200, no free-form fields; each field with a justification approved by the reviewer. The reason is that the model decides what to send and a malicious step could tell it to gather data from other connectors.
3. **Output**: validated by `outputSchema` (short strings), a 256 KB cap read in streaming (body already decompressed), treated as **untrusted data**, marked in the return value.
4. **Secrets**: only the name in the manifest; the value lives in `package_secrets`, encrypted with the server's KEK, injected on the server, never returned or logged; no raw `fetch` error message goes to a log or a response.
5. **Limits**: default timeout 10 s (maximum 20 s), a global concurrency cap, a limit per tool and per creator (the 60-call quota belongs only to the free trial and does not protect a paid session). No connection reuse across creators.
6. **Identity**: no header carrying a wallet or session; if the creator needs a per-user id, they receive an HMAC per (user, agent).
7. **Transparency and consent**: `egress: true` is mandatory; the storefront says "this tool sends the information you provide to a service run by the creator" and the preflight asks the user to confirm before the first call.
8. **Domain**: proof through `/.well-known/solvers-verify.txt` with the package's `id`, **re-verified weekly** (that check is another access to a creator URL and uses the **same secure client** as item 1); shared-hosting domains (`vercel.app`, `github.io`, `workers.dev`, `netlify.app` and similar) are rejected.
9. **Changing the endpoint or the fields sent is a MAJOR change** (§15.4) and requires a full review.
10. **Monitoring and suspension**: the error rate and out-of-schema responses suspend the tool automatically.

---

## 9. Verifier and guarantee

* The Docker verifier (`verifier/`) and escrow remain **platform-exclusive**.
* **Third parties: no guarantee in the Core phase.** The code already has the rule: only someone with `GUARANTEE_MIN_SALES` sales (default 10) and a minimum rating offers a guarantee (`store/mappers.ts`); "20 USD for a new account" is the cap on the **buyer's** open guarantees (`shared/rules.ts`). But the VPS environment turns it off for the demo (`GUARANTEE_MIN_SALES=0`, D11), so the prohibition comes from the **validator**: `guarantee.available: true` in a third-party submission is the error `MANIFEST_GUARANTEE_FORBIDDEN`. With `verify: "manual"` the payment goes out on its own after 72 h and disputes land on you; releasing this to third parties is left until after the Opening phase.
* A creator's own verifier: reserved (together with the `container` runner).

---

## 10. Calibration on first use **[Core]**

Adapts the Solver to the user with a few questions, without altering any model.

### 10.1 Declaration

`manifest.onboarding.questions[]`, from 1 to 5:

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `id` | `[a-z0-9_]+`, unique |
| `ask` | 10-200 characters |
| `why` | 10-200 characters; the model may explain it |
| `options` | optional, 2-6; without `options`, a free-form answer |

Every question can be skipped (there is no `required`). It requires `usesMemory: true`. The validator **flags** sensitive-data questions (warning `ONBOARDING_SENSITIVE`, by a term list, which synonyms can bypass) and the reviewer decides.

### 10.2 Flow (in the real order of the tools)

1. `activate_solver` -> `preflight_check` (as today). **Change**: when the agent uses memory, the `preflight_check` text (and the reused-session return of `activate_solver`) now tells the model to call `get_memory`; today that is only a suggestion from `activate_solver` (a "hint") and does not appear in a reused session.
2. `get_memory` (which receives only `agent_id`). If the agent has `onboarding` and there is no `profile`, the return includes `needs_onboarding` with the questions and the instruction: "Ask these questions in at most two messages, explain the reason, accept skipping".
3. The model calls `save_memory({ agent_id, kind: "profile", content })` with the answers. **If the user skips**, it stores `profile: { "skipped": true }`: a profile with `skipped` also ends `needs_onboarding`, so the question does not come back every session.
4. The steps read the profile through `get_memory`. The profile is **user data**, marked as such; it cannot remove gates.
5. "Recalibrate" repeats the questions and replaces the profile (including `skipped`).

**Without a memory key** (a connection without the second signature, where `memoryKeyFor` returns empty today): the return is `onboarding_unavailable`, the Solver carries on with defaults and says how to reconnect. There is no eternal calibration.

The profile applies in the free trial.

---

## 11. Memory **[changes, Core]**

### 11.1 Format

The `memories` table and the encryption (AES-256-GCM, a key derived from the wallet signature) **do not change**. The encrypted content is already a JSON with `summary`; v1 adds two optional fields, so there is **no migration** and the current packages stay the same:

```jsonc
{
  "summary": "old text (replaced as a whole)",                                 // [exists]
  "profile": { "profile": "Balanced" },                                        // [new] calibration
  "notes": [ { "id": "n_ab12", "text": "Uses Next.js 15", "at": "2026-09-30T18:00:00Z" } ]  // [new]
}
```

Limits: `summary` <= 4,000 characters (as today), `profile` <= 2,000, up to 30 notes of 3 to 500 characters, total encrypted size <= 24 KB. **`summary` becomes optional** (default `""`): a memory with only a profile or notes must not appear as "undefined" (today `readMemories` reads `payload.summary` with no tolerance).

### 11.2 Tools

| Tool | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `get_memory({ agent_id })` | Returns `summary`, `profile` and `notes` as user data, plus `needs_onboarding` when applicable. **Read-only** (migrates nothing) |
| `save_memory({ agent_id, content, kind? })` | `kind: "summary"` (default, **same as the current one**): replaces the whole summary. `"note"`: adds a note. `"profile"`: replaces the profile |
| `forget_memory({ agent_id, note_id })` **[new]** | Removes a note |

**Required fixes**:

1. **Check access**: today `get_memory` and `save_memory` accept any `agent_id` (`findAgentRow` only looks in the catalog). In v1 they require an **active session for that agent (paid or free trial) or a license**. The free trial must keep working: the profile and memory apply in it.
2. **Concurrency**: every `kind` becomes read, merge, write (today `saveMemory` rewrites only `{summary}` and would erase `profile` and `notes`). `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` does not lock a row that does not exist yet, so the first write uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and then locks the row; only then does it merge. Parallel calls do not lose data.
3. **Whatever reads the old format** has to be updated: `store/me.ts` (`/me/memories`), the `Memory` type in `packages/shared` and `Memories.tsx` now show profile and notes; deleting still removes the row.

**Product rule**: notes only **at the user's request** ("save this so I don't forget"); the profile only in calibration. The MCP server's instruction says so. In the interface the name is **"specialist memory"**: it is not on the blockchain, only encrypted on the server and tied to the wallet.

---

## 12. Evals and ratings

### 12.1 Cases **[exists, changes]**

`evals/cases/*.json`, from **10 to 40** per package:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "02-freelancer-reserve",
  "input": "I'm self-employed and earn between 3 and 7 thousand a month. How much should I keep as a reserve?",
  "checks": [
    { "type": "contains", "value": "worst month", "description": "Uses the worst month as the baseline" },
    { "type": "regex", "value": "\\d+\\s*months", "description": "Reserve expressed in months" },
    { "type": "not_contains", "value": "guaranteed", "description": "Does not promise returns" }
  ],
  "rubric": ["The answer explains how variable income changes the reserve"],   // [new, Opening]
  "mustCallTools": ["calculate_reserve"]                                       // [new, Opening]
}
```

`rubric` and `mustCallTools` only take effect when **the platform runs the case** (`platform_run`). In the `checks` method, the `outputs/*.md` files are text: some current cases (`planejador-viagens/06-memoria-inicio`, `frontend-react/11-run-tests`) evaluate the transcript with the tool calls written into the text, but that is fragile and does not prove the tool ran.

### 12.2 Labeled methods

| `evalMethod` | How it arises | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| `checks` | The creator (or the team) generates the answers and runs the local grader (regex, contains, not contains) | Creator dashboard and reviewer only. **Never a public third-party rating** |
| `platform_run` | **The platform** generates the answers with its own model and real tools, and an automatic judge (plus the checks) scores them; it keeps the answers and the reasoning | Storefront: "evaluated by the platform" **[Opening]** |
| `verified` | A reproducible execution with a verifier (tests running on the server) | Storefront: "verified performance" (platform only) |

**Golden rule**: the on-chain `scoreBps` (`setEval(agentId, versionHash, scoreBps, evalHash)`, signed by the VERIFIER key) is only written from `platform_run` or `verified`. A `judge` over answers written by the creator **does not exist**: whoever writes the ideal answer would pass, and the judge can be instructed by the text itself. The platform's LLM cost has a per-creator budget.

**Current ratings** (the 6 published): they were generated by the team (answers from an agent with the specialist active, without seeing the checks) and scored by regex. The storefront and `find_solver` used to say "verified performance"; **since 2026-10-02 (P5 partial, `feat/criador-solvers` branch)** they say "internal team test (automatic checks)" and, with no rating (`evalScoreBps = 0`), "No reviews yet", until they are redone with `platform_run`. "Verified" only applies to `evalMethod: verified`, which does not exist yet (nor does the `evalMethod` field: the Registry stores a numeric `scoreBps` per version). No new rating is written without a valid method.

**Version-scoped ratings** (decision D6): the Registry keeps one eval per `(agentId, versionHash)`. `updateVersion` changes nothing in it; readers (`currentEval`) treat an eval whose `versionHash` differs from the agent's current one as "not measured for this version" until `setEval` is called for the new hash. The label rule does not change: "internal team test", never "verified".

### 12.3 `report.json` **[changes]**

```jsonc
{ "specVersion": 1, "version": "1.0.1", "evalMethod": "checks", "method": "free text (existing)",
  "cases": 12, "passed": 11, "scoreBps": 9167, "runAt": "2026-09-30T18:00:00Z",
  "model": "claude-opus-5-5", "results": [ { "id": "...", "passed": true, "failed": [] } ] }
```

With `platform_run` there are also `judgeModel` and `judgeNotes`. **Reproducibility**: the stamped report and its stored hash are the truth; re-running generates a new report (an LLM does not guarantee identical output, even at temperature 0, and in some models the parameter does not even exist).

### 12.4 Minimums

* **10 cases** per package; the mock wizard says 30 and will be aligned.
* The **80%** minimum (`MIN_SCORE`, which today only exists in the site's mock) is checked by the reviewer and, in the Opening phase, by the server.
* Today, 3 packages have 8 cases (`copy-marketing`, `financas-pessoais`, `revisao-contratos`) and 2 (`backend-node`, `planilhas-dados`) have 0: the validator gives the warning `EVAL_TOO_FEW_CASES` in v0, and an error in v1.

---

## 13. Validator

A server module (`validatePackage`), **a single implementation**:

| Consumer | Form |
|---|---|
| Upload on the site | `POST /api/creator/submissions` only **saves** the ZIP in streaming and answers **202**; extraction, scans and validation run **in the worker** (§16), not in the API process |
| Solver Builder | the `builtin:validate-package` tool, called through `run_tool`. It receives the manifest, the step text, the list of files with sizes and the first lines of the knowledge (up to 1 MB per call, the `/mcp` limit). It validates **manifest and steps**; full validation (chunks, evals, templates, extraction) only exists at upload or in the script |
| CLI | `solvers validate <folder or zip>` (same module; in this phase, a repository script) |
| Server loader | `packages()` uses the same module for new packages |

Single output:

```jsonc
{ "ok": false,
  "errors":   [ { "code": "STEP_SECTION_MISSING", "path": "steps/02-plan.md", "message": "Missing the '## How to run' section (the Portuguese title '## Como executar' is also accepted)", "fix": "Add the section with numbered steps" } ],
  "warnings": [ ],
  "stats":    { "files": 42, "knowledgeChunksEstimate": 1830, "steps": 4, "cases": 12, "differentiators": ["memory"] } }
```

An error blocks the submission; a warning goes to the reviewer. The full catalog is in Appendix A. The HTTP error format follows the repository's `{ error, code, details? }` standard: 400 validation, 401/403 access, 409 `id`/`slug`/version conflict, 413 size, 429 limits. The JSON schema (generated from zod with `zod-to-json-schema`) is at `/api/spec/manifest.schema.json`.

---

## 14. Submission and manual review

### 14.1 Who submits

* **Core**: only **invited** creators. You generate a code (table `creator_invites(code, email, wallet, created_at, used_at)`), send it by email, and the creator enters it after logging in (Privy): their wallet is bound to the invite and `creators.invited` becomes `true`. The profile requires a name, a bio, acceptance of the terms and a **verified escalation contact**: the creator links Telegram themselves: `POST /creator/telegram-link` generates a `LINK-XXXXXXXX` code (only the hash is stored in `creators`, 15 min, single use, 5 per hour) and the creator sends it to the bot (`/link <code>`, alias `/vincular`, or the deep link `/start <code>`), handled by `solvers-tempo-worker`, which writes `creators.telegramChatId` (`cli:invite set-chat` remains as an admin shortcut); the server sends no email. The table row is only created by `cli/publish.ts`; the creator's profile is created at sign-up (a new route), with a generated `creators.id`.
* **Opening**: any signed-in user with a complete profile, with limits (3 pending and 5 submissions per day per creator) and an entry fee defined in §2.2.

This **replaces** the decision in `FRONT_PLAN.md:13` ("admin approval for each creator's first 2"): now it is 100% of versions.

### 14.2 States

```
submitted → validating ─error→ rejected_validation
                │ ok
                ▼
          pending_review ─→ changes_requested ─new submission (same version)→ validating
                │        └→ rejected
                ▼ approve (records the approved version: hash, price, version)
   awaiting_creator_signature ─creator co-signs register/update→ awaiting_onchain_approval
                                                                        │ (new Solver only; you sign approveAgent)
                                                                        ▼
                                          publishing ─fails→ publish_failed (admin retries)
                                               ▼
                                           published ─→ superseded (new version published)
                                               ├→ suspended ⇄ published (suspend and resume)
                                               └→ withdrawn ⇄ published (creator withdraws and reactivates)
```

When updating an already-approved Solver, `awaiting_onchain_approval` is skipped (`updateVersion` keeps the on-chain `Active` status). There is no `draft` (the submission is all at once). Resubmitting after `changes_requested` keeps the same `version` if it has not been published yet; once published, the new version must be greater.

### 14.3 Tables **[new]**

```
package_submissions(id, creator_wallet, slug, version, status, zip_path, size_bytes,
                    manifest jsonb, validation jsonb, scans jsonb, created_at, updated_at)
package_reviews(id, submission_id, reviewer_wallet, action, notes, checklist jsonb,

### 14.4 Endpoints **[new]**

| Route | Who | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/creator/submissions` | invited creator | Receives the ZIP in **streaming** to disk, creates the submission (`submitted`) and answers **202**; the worker validates (§13) |
| `GET /api/creator/submissions[/:id]` | creator | State, validator errors, reviewer notes |
| `GET /api/admin/submissions?status=` and `/:id` | admin | Queue and preview |
| `POST /api/admin/submissions/:id/(approve|request-changes|reject)` | admin | A reason is mandatory; `approve` records the approved version and moves to `awaiting_creator_signature` |
| `GET /api/tx/publication/:submissionId` | creator | What is still missing on-chain (the next step), read from the chain at that moment |
| `POST /api/tx/(register-agent|update-version|update-pricing)` | creator | Builds the call batch **at the moment of the click** (one Tempo transaction, simulated before it is returned; the wallet sets a short `validBefore` window), with the platform relay as fee payer, for the creator to sign. Reads price, hash, version, royalty and license cap **from the approved record and the validated manifest, never from the client**; checks `wallet == creator_wallet` and the submission's state. `update-pricing` only exists for an update with changed terms (`registerAgent` already writes the price) |
| `POST /api/tx/publication/confirm` | creator | Confirms the publication by **transaction hash**: the server reads the receipt and checks the events against the approved id, `versionHash`, price and terms |
| `POST /api/admin/submissions/:id/finish` | admin | Completes the publication (§15.3, step 5) when the on-chain approval event does not arrive on its own |
| `GET /api/spec/manifest.schema.json` | public | Schema |

**Admin** = a wallet in `ADMIN_WALLETS` (an environment variable), confirmed by login. **Approving on the site signs nothing on-chain** (§15.2).

**Nginx**: a dedicated `location` for the upload, with `client_max_body_size 60m`, `proxy_request_buffering off` (otherwise nginx buffers the body on the system's shared disk), `client_body_timeout`, its own `limit_req` and authentication checked before reading the body; the route is mounted before `express.json` (256 KB). The `limit_req_zone` is defined in the **global** `nginx.conf` (shared infrastructure; D5). **To verify**: if the domain sits behind Cloudflare, the plan's body cap may be below 50 MB.

### 14.5 Review screen (`/admin/reviews`) **[new]**

**Screen security**: all creator content is displayed as **escaped text** (never rendered HTML); Markdown previews in a sandboxed `iframe` without scripts, with CSP and `nosniff`, without the session cookie. The panel of whoever has the power to publish is the most valuable target.

Preview content:

1. Summary: name, creator, version, category, price, declared and proven differentiators.
2. Validator: errors (empty) and warnings.
3. Manifest and steps, with an **automatic diff of ALL files** (including knowledge) against the published version.
4. Knowledge: files, source and date, chunk count and expired-chunk count; the reviewer can run **test searches** on the staging ingestion.
5. Templates: full content. Evals: cases, method, results.
6. **Automatic scans**: invisible and bidirectional Unicode; hidden HTML/CSS; injection patterns; URLs; content duplicated from published packages (chunk hash); sensitive calibration questions; `searchPhrases` off-topic for the content.
7. **Checklist** (stored in `package_reviews.checklist`, immutable):
   * Quality: is the promise delivered by the steps? 2 of 5 differentiators proven?
   * Rights: sources listed and permission for third-party content?
   * Security: an instruction to act **against the user** or send data out? Injection in any text, including text that only appears for a specific query?
   * Price, free trial (shows value without handing over everything) and storefront coherent; no promise of financial, legal or medical results without a disclaimer.

Limitation of human review: it does not guarantee finding an injection hidden in one knowledge chunk among thousands, nor a conditional behavior. That is why the Core phase has small caps and invites. In the Opening phase, 100% of chunks go through a classifier (LLM plus rules) before the reviewer.

**Notifications**: a new submission and every state change notify you on Telegram (the mechanism already used in `escalate_to_creator`). Response time to the creator: a 5-business-day target.

---

## 15. Publication, on-chain and versions

### 15.1 Storage

* `SUBMISSIONS_DIR = /var/www/solvers/shared/submissions` (the original ZIP and the extracted folder).
* `PUBLISHED_DIR = /var/www/solvers/shared/packages` (one active package per `slug`, atomic swap by `rename`; the previous version goes to `_archive/<slug>/<version>/`).
* `AGENTS_DIR` keeps reading the platform packages (it is a link to the active release). `packages()` now merges the two sources; a duplicate `id` or `slug` **fails the load** (today the last one wins and overwrites).
* Outside git and the release, so they survive deploys (which `rm -rf` old releases). `shared/` is the folder `deploy.sh` already uses for data that survives (the VPS guide defines `/var/www/<project>`, not `shared/`). **Needs backup**: the guide's weekly backup tarballs `/var/www/<project>` with 4 weeks' retention, so 20 GB here becomes 80 GB on the 97 GB disk; that is why the shared `/opt/deploy/backup.sh` has to be edited (D5) to exclude ZIPs and `_archive` from the tarball and include only what matters (published packages and the database), with cleanup of rejected ZIPs (30 days) and archived versions.
* The server serves **one version per package**: the active one. Open sessions on an old version receive `session_outdated` (409) and reactivate, **as today** (`assertSessionCurrent`). The previous version's chunks are deleted only after the new one is ready (no window without RAG).

### 15.2 Who signs on-chain (decision D2)

* `registerAgent`, `updateVersion` and `updatePricing` (also `setRoyaltyBps` and `setSupplyCap`) require the **creator's** signature (`NotCreator` otherwise). The server does not hold that key (embedded Privy; only the public address is known), and the creator keys `cli:publish` generates for platform packages are **refused on mainnet**. So the flow is the same as the other `/tx/*`: the server builds the call batch (a new Solver: `[approve(staking, minStake)?, registerAgent, setSupplyCap?]`; an update: `updateVersion` plus the changed terms); the creator's wallet signs **one** Tempo transaction in the browser and the platform relay co-signs as fee payer; the site then confirms it by hash (`/api/tx/publication/confirm`). Every **new version** needs that signature again.
* `approveAgent` requires the Registry's **default admin**, which is a cold wallet off the VPS (the key is given to the CLI with `--key-file`; on mainnet the server refuses to load an admin key). That is why "Approve" on the site only unlocks; **you sign `approveAgent` locally** (`cli:approve`, in this phase), and the RELAY key pays the fee (the cold wallet holds no tokens). A new version of an already-approved agent keeps the `Active` status on-chain, so the update depends only on the flow above. The same goes for suspending on-chain (`suspendAgent`, `cli:suspend`; §15.4).
* If `minStake` goes above 0, the creator needs that amount of the payment token for the deposit (the Registry pulls it into `SolversStaking` at registration).

### 15.3 Publication sequence (the code's order, which the spec does not invert)

1. **Approval on the site.** Records the approved version (hash, price, version) in `agent_published_versions` **before any transaction**, and moves to `awaiting_creator_signature`. Recording afterwards would be too late: the confirmation indexes the transaction immediately (`syncAgent`) and the indexer would see the legitimate publication as "unapproved".
2. **Knowledge**: the staging chunks are renamed to the real version.
3. **Chain, creator's part**: `registerAgent` (new Solver) or `updateVersion` (update), co-signed on the site in one batched transaction; `updatePricing` only if the price changed. `updateVersion` does **not** erase the ratings of earlier versions (D6), but the new version reads as "not measured" until `setEval` for its `versionHash` (platform packages only, §12).
4. **Chain, admin's part** (new Solver only): `awaiting_onchain_approval`; you sign `approveAgent` with the cold wallet (`cli:approve <slug|submissionId>`).
5. **Catalog**: triggered by the chain's status event (`AgentStatusChanged`) or by the admin's "Finish" button: upsert of the agent and the search vectors, `syncAgent`, `reloadPackages()` (nobody calls it today), `platform_status = active`.

If a step fails, the state goes to `publish_failed` and the admin resumes; the storefront does not change before step 5 (today's `cli:publish` has the same order for this reason). **Backfill**: the versions already published today (6) must be seeded into `agent_published_versions`; without that the indexer would flag all of them as "unapproved".

### 15.4 Versions, on-chain bypass and the kill switch

* **Served version = approved version.** The creator can call `updateVersion` and `updatePricing` directly on-chain without going through review. The indexer (`syncAgent`) cannot simply copy the version, hash and price from the chain: it compares with `agent_published_versions`; if they diverge, it sets `agents.sync_flag = unapproved_chain_version`. Effects: the delivered package stays the one on disk (the approved one); the storefront shows the approved price and version; **sales are blocked** (`/api/purchases/intent` answers 409 `price_in_review`, and `assertFreshPrice` would otherwise compare against a different price forever) until the creator reverts on-chain or you approve the new version.
* **Semver**: `MAJOR` = changes `tools`, the `http` endpoint, `onboarding`, `requirements` or the structure of `steps`; `MINOR` = new content; `PATCH` = a fix. **All** go through full review with an automatic diff of all files (a reduced checklist would be the channel for the "good version, then swap" scam).
* **Kill switch**: today the status is only checked in `activate_solver`; `next_step`, `run_tool`, `search_knowledge` and `get_memory` only check that the package exists, and paid sessions last 24 h (and the automatic `delist` says it remains valid for those who already bought). On top of that, `syncAgent` **rewrites `agents.status` with the on-chain account's value on every event** (including `UsageRecorded` and `LicensePurchased`), so a suspension made only in the database reverts to `active` on the next event. In v1:
  1. Suspension is a **separate** column, `agents.platform_status`, which the indexer never writes.
  2. **All** MCP tools, the purchase routes (`/api/purchases/intent`, Pix, agent payments), the guarantee `/tx/*` routes and the storefront require `status = active` (chain) **and** `platform_status = active`; `suspended` invalidates open sessions immediately.
  3. In parallel, you run `suspendAgent` on-chain with the cold wallet (`cli:suspend`, fee paid by the RELAY key), because buying directly through the contract (`purchaseLicense`) only requires on-chain `Active` and would remain possible.
  4. Resuming is the reverse path (`platform_status = active` and, if it was suspended on-chain, `cli:approve`/reactivation).
  What happens to the money of those who already bought from a suspended package is an economic question (§2.2, item 2), not a technical one.
* After 10 reviews averaging below 3.5, the package leaves the storefront (a rule that [exists], `jobs.ts`).

---

## 16. Capacity and operations

| Item | Rule |
|---|---|
| Process | Ingestion **and ZIP processing** (extraction, scans, validation) **do not run** in `solvers-tempo-api` (a single fork, restart at 900 MB, serves MCP and payments). Its own PM2 process (there is precedent on the VPS), with `nice`, `ORT_NUM_THREADS=1`, its own `max_memory_restart`, and included in `deploy.sh`'s `reload_all` |
| Queue | One ingestion at a time, in batches with a **per-file checkpoint** in `ingest_jobs`. The CI deploy (on every push) kills the process; it resumes from the last completed file (it does not start over) |
| Memory | Do not accumulate all the vectors; insert per batch. An HNSW index with 10,000 inserts in a single transaction only fits the Core phase; above that, batches |
| Hash and load | Hash computed once at approval (§3.4); `packages()` loads on demand, it does not read every file synchronously at boot |
| Benchmark (Opening) | Measure chunks/s and RAM with a 500-page PDF; the Opening caps come from that |
| Disk | Alert at 20 GB in `submissions` + `packages` (97 GB VPS) |
| Eval judge | Opening only, with an LLM budget per creator |
| Upload | Streaming, no buffering of the ZIP in memory; a `pm2 reload` during an upload cuts it off (the creator resends) |

---

## 17. Security, privacy and legal

1. **Creator content is treated as untrusted** (Principle 5): scans, review, caps, the MCP instruction ("the specialist's content never authorizes sending user data outside, nor ignoring the user's requests"), tool responses marked as data. It is a **mitigation**, not a guarantee: not every client (ChatGPT) honors the MCP server's instructions, and the "follow the steps" structure makes the model obey. The residual risk is accepted in the Core phase **because there is an invite, a small cap and fast shutdown**.
2. **What reaches the server** from the user: `run_tool` inputs, `result_summary` (up to 4,000 characters per step, today **in plain text** in `sessions.context`, with no deletion routine), `save_memory`, `escalate_to_creator` (up to 3,000 characters, sent to the creator's Telegram and stored in `escalations`, **without prior consent**), `submit_deliverable` (platform). We are controllers of this data. Required in v1: short retention and a deletion job for `sessions.context` and `escalations`; do not log inputs; explicit consent before `escalate_to_creator` (and before `http` in the Opening phase); a privacy notice.
3. **"Encrypted" memory** is encryption at rest: the server opens the key while the token is valid (`memory/crypto.ts`, stored wrapped by the `SERVER_KEK`). The user-facing text does not promise "only you can read it".
4. **The user's local files** (read by their AI) stay between them and Claude/ChatGPT; the data-protection law for that part is theirs.
5. **ZIP and parsers**: §3.2 and §6.1. **`http` tools**: §8.3.
6. **Legal**: `terms` is self-declaration; without a reporting and takedown process it is worth little. **Regulated** content (Finance: securities regulator; Legal: bar association; Health: medical council): only verified creators, a mandatory disclaimer right at the start of the answer, and the platform's "approved" badge is worded so as not to look like a professional endorsement. The clause "the reviewer assumes no liability" does not protect against consumer law; that is why legal review is a prerequisite of the Opening phase (§2.2).
7. **Ranking**: the reviewer checks `searchPhrases` against the content; the "uses" counter (which feeds `trend7d` and the on-chain batches) now deduplicates by wallet and day.
8. **Audit trail**: `package_reviews` is insert-only, with `version_hash`, the diff snapshot, the checklist, the IP and the `approveAgent` transaction.
9. **A logging failure is never silent**: today's `logUsage` swallows errors (`.catch(() => undefined)`); it now raises an alert.

---

## 18. Compatibility and migration

* **Current packages (8 in `agents/`, 6 published)**: no `specVersion` = v0; the loader accepts them as today; the new rules are **warnings**. The platform migrates them to v1 when it wants.
* **Old runners** remain as aliases of `builtin:*`, for platform packages only.
* **Text gates** remain valid. **Memory**: no migration (§11). **`catalogOnly`**: ignored with a warning.
* **Current on-chain ratings**: labeled "internal test" until they are redone (§12.2).
* **Out of v1**: `container`, the creator's verifier, scanned PDFs (OCR), reranking/hybrid search, private per-user RAG, publishing without review, third-party guarantees, a public third-party rating without platform execution.

## 19. The Solver Builder

A platform Solver (`platform: true`, authority on the server), free, **database only** (no on-chain registration; D3), with no free trial and no license. It **does not contain the schema**: it asks the validator. Its slug is `criador-de-solvers`.

### 19.1 Package

```
agents/criador-de-solvers/
  manifest.json      # tools: validate_package (builtin:validate-package). No onboarding in v0
  steps/             # 7 steps (§19.2)
  knowledge/         # this specification, best practices by Solver type, complete examples
  templates/         # skeletons: manifest, step, front matter, eval case, calibration question
  evals/cases/       # 12 cases
```

`get_template` is the global tool (§7) and serves the skeletons; `validate_package` is an ordinary manifest tool, called through `run_tool`.

### 19.2 The 7 steps

| # | Step | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Promise and audience**: what it solves, for whom, what it does not do | `tagline`, `description`, `searchPhrases`, category |
| 2 | **Differentiators**: choose >= 2 of the 5 and how to prove them | `differentiators` and a plan for each |
| 3 | **Process and gates**: 3 to 6 steps with the 5 sections | valid `steps/*.md` (validator with no errors on the steps) |
| 4 | **Knowledge**: collection, converting PDFs to `.md` in the user's AI, metadata, sources, validity, rights | `knowledge/` with front matter |
| 5 | **Tools and verification**: in the Core phase, explains what is left for the Opening phase | a record of the plan |
| 6 | **Calibration and memory**: first-use questions | `onboarding` |
| 7 | **Evals and packaging**: 10+ cases, `validate_package` (manifest and steps), assemble the ZIP and run the `solvers validate` script on the whole ZIP | a ZIP ready with no errors in the script |

### 19.3 ZIP delivery

It depends on the client: in **Claude Code** the AI writes the folder and runs the `solvers validate` script; in **Claude/ChatGPT with file generation** it generates the ZIP for download; **without that**, it delivers the files in blocks with the walkthrough (the user assembles the ZIP; the site validates at upload time). The **final submission is through the site** (or the script), always validated again on the server.

### 19.4 Why it is the first package

It is the test of the format: if the Builder generates a valid package for a new topic, the specification is clear.

---

## 20. What the end user sees

| Information | Where it comes from | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| The Solver's differentiators | `differentiators` checked by the reviewer | Storefront, `find_solver` |
| Rating method | `evalMethod` (§12.2) | Storefront, `find_solver`, `describeAgent` (**done on 2026-10-02**: with no rating it shows "no reviews yet"; with a rating, "internal team test (automatic checks)"; never "verified". Code: `evalLabel` in `mcp/agent-text.ts` and `apps/web/src/lib/eval-label.ts`. The `evalMethod` field itself is still pending) |
| Knowledge sources and freshness | `knowledge.sources`, `updatedAt` | The specialist's page |
| Data sent to third parties (`egress`) | `tools[].egress` | Storefront and preflight (Opening) |
| Templates and calibration | `templates[]`, `onboarding` | The specialist's page |

This data lives in `agents.details` (the existing JSON) and in the `packages/shared` types. Affected screens: `solvers/[slug]/page.tsx`, `AgentSections`, `AgentCard`; tools: `describeAgent`, `find_solver`; `preflight.ts`.

The creator sees the reason for a rejection or "changes requested" on the submissions screen, with the reviewer's text and the validator errors.

---

## 21. Still-open questions

1. Which model and API key does the platform use for `platform_run` (Opening) and how much does it cost per package (12 cases ≈ 12 answers + 12 judgments)?
2. Format of the CLI (`solvers validate|eval|submit`): in this phase, repository scripts; a public npm package later?
3. Free trial per person: implemented with Privy's verified email (`apps/server/src/auth/person.ts`, `docs/concepts-guide.md`); the limits come from the manifest.
4. Retention of `usage_events` and logs: how long and what to anonymize (the items in §17 (item 2)).
5. Is the domain behind Cloudflare? That defines the upload cap (§14.4).

---

## 22. Implementation plan

Size is **relative** (S, M, L), not a schedule estimate. A phase only starts once the D decisions in the "Depends on" column are resolved.

| Phase | Delivery | Depends on | Size | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Spec approved. **Harden the current code** (fixes that pay off even without third parties): containment of manifest paths (§3.3); `slug`/`version` regex; `slug` != `id` format and separate maps; fail on duplicate `id`/`slug`; an `agents.platform_status` column separate from the chain status, checked in **all** MCP tools and in the purchase routes (§15.4); `get_memory`/`save_memory` require an **active session (paid or trial) or a license** (§11.2); `logUsage` no longer swallows errors | D1-D4 | S | New tests cover each fix; suspending through the database drops an open session and survives an indexer event |
| **P1** | `validatePackage`, JSON schema, the `validate` script, the code catalog (Appendix A) | P0 | M | One test per Appendix A code; the 8 current packages with no **errors** (in v0, rules for new fields such as `terms` and `evidence` are warnings) |
| **P2** | Solver Builder v0: a new `platform` access type (no license), **excluded** from the usage-batch job (`jobs.ts`) and with a guard in the purchase routes and `assertFreshPrice`; price and buy button hidden on the storefront; `ownedAgents`, `describeAgent`, `PLATFORM_AGENTS`; `builtin:validate-package` (manifest and steps, §13); `get_template`; `cli:publish --no-chain` | P1, D3 | M | A ZIP generated by the Builder for a new topic passes the **ZIP validation script** |
| **P3** | Memory v2 (profile, `skipped`, notes, concurrency, `/me/memories` screens), calibration (the `preflight` text calls `get_memory`), `get_template` for declared templates, `.md`/`.txt` knowledge with metadata, citations, `valid_until`, daily quota, honest watermark text | P1 | M | Calibration flow on a real package; old-format reading intact; a memory test with parallel calls |
| **P4** | Invite-only submission: `creator_invites`, the creator profile and Telegram linking, ZIP upload (202) and processing in the PM2 worker with checkpoint, staging, the (secure) review screen, Telegram, storage in `shared/`, `/tx/*` with co-signing, `cli:approve`, `cli:suspend`, `agent_published_versions` with backfill, the indexer comparing versions, nginx; `backup.sh` (D5) | P0, P1, P3, D2, D5, D9-D14 | L | A test package goes up through the ZIP, is reviewed and published (every state in §14.2) and appears on the storefront; a version changed directly on-chain does not change what is served and blocks sales; suspending drops an open session and blocks a direct purchase |
| **P5** | Storefront and tools with an honest rating method (`evalMethod`, "no reviews yet"), case minimums, privacy texts, retention and deletion of `sessions.context` and `escalations`, consent before `escalate_to_creator` | P4 | S | No screen says "verified" without `verified` |
| **P6** (pre-opening) | The §2.2 items that depend on code or on you: a free trial per person; creator dashboard (verified contact, payouts, tickets); the economics rule (deposit via `minStake`); terms, reporting policy and legal review (outside the code); capacity benchmark and upload security test; real `GUARANTEE_*` | P5 | L | The §2.2 checklist complete |
| **— Opening checkpoint —** | You decide whether to open to strangers | P6 | | |
| **P7** (Opening) | Isolated parsers (PDF/HTML/CSV); the `http` runner (only turns on **after** the §8.3 security test); gates with evidence (`tool_runs`); `platform_run` (evals run by the platform); third-party guarantee; larger caps | checkpoint | L | Security tests of `http` and the parsers approved |
| **P8** | The site's real wizard pointed at the APIs | P4 | M | The wizard publishes the same thing as the script |

**Status (2026-09-30):** P0 and P1 implemented on the `worktree-spec-p0-p1` branch (uncommitted, not deployed). P0: path containment (`runtime/package-paths.ts`, `package-loader.ts`), `slug`/`version` format (`agent-ids.ts`), `id`/`slug` collision, `agents.platform_status` (migration `0010`) checked in all tools, in the purchase route and in the guarantees and never written by the indexer (`indexer/mirror.ts`), memory only with a license or session, a logging failure that is no longer silent. P1: `runtime/validate/*` (the single validator, 67 codes, JSON Schema), `npm run cli:validate` and `cli:schema`. Tests: `test/packages.test.ts`, `platform-status.test.ts`, `platform-status.db.test.ts` (with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`) and `validate.test.ts`. The deploy applies migration `0010` by itself (`infra/deploy.sh` runs `db:migrate`). ZIP reading in `cli:validate` arrives with P4's extractor (today the script reads folders).

**Status (2026-10-02):** implemented on the `feat/criador-solvers` branch (commits `3189fcb`, `f1cdad7`, `fac5c2e`, `0efe6bf`, `18ddc5d`; **not deployed**).

**Tempo rebuild (2026-10-11):** the whole flow was carried over to the Tempo contracts in this repository (fresh database baseline, so the migration numbers below are history). The on-chain calls are the `SolversRegistry` functions named in §15; the creator's batch is sponsored by the platform relay and the cold admin's calls by the RELAY key.

| Phase | State | Where it is |
|---|---|---|
| P0, P1 | Done (see the 2026-09-30 status above) | `runtime/validate/*`, `cli:validate`, `cli:schema` |
| P2 | Done | `runtime/platform-agents.ts`, the `platform` access, `builtin:validate-package`, `get_template`, `cli:publish --no-chain`, `agents/criador-de-solvers` |
| P3 | Done | memory v2, calibration, `.md`/`.txt` with metadata and `valid_until` in the RAG |
| P4 | Done | `creator/`, `submissions/`, `publish/`, `review/`, `worker/`, `cli/invite.ts`, `cli/approve.ts`, `cli/suspend.ts`, migrations 0016 to 0018, `infra/` (PM2 worker, nginx, deploy); screens `/creator/publish`, `/creator/submissions/[id]`, `/admin/reviews` |
| P5 | **Partial**: only the honest rating labels (§12.2 and §20). Pending: `evalMethod` in the contract, case minimums checked by the server, privacy texts, retention and deletion of `sessions.context` and `escalations`, consent before `escalate_to_creator` | `mcp/agent-text.ts` (`evalLabel`), `apps/web/src/lib/eval-label.ts` |
| P6 | Pending (pre-opening, §2.2) | |
| P7 | Pending (Opening) | |
| P8 | Done, with a deviation: the site has the real flow (profile, ZIP upload, tracking, co-signing), but **not** the wizard that assembles the package; the Solver Builder assembles it. The fake wizard was removed (DEF-18) | `apps/web/src/components/creator/*` |

**Implementation deviations** (the code is the truth; the spec above describes the original intent):

* **`platform` access**: the new access type is `platform` and the authority is the server's `PLATFORM_AGENTS` list (the `slug` + `id` pair), never the manifest's `platform` field. The list is only accepted if the package comes from `AGENTS_DIR`; the same `id` or `slug` in a creator's published package brings the load down.
* **Worker as a PM2 process** (`solvers-tempo-worker`, `infra/ecosystem.config.cjs`): extracts, validates, scans and ingests. Attempts in `package_submissions.attempts` (maximum 3; once exhausted, the submission becomes `rejected_validation` and the admin is notified). `SUBMISSIONS_INLINE=true` processes inside the API (QA only).
* **Extra review actions**: `revoke` (the admin undoes an unsigned approval; goes back to `changes_requested`, route `POST /api/admin/submissions/:id/revoke`), `expire` (the system, as `system`), `finish`, `suspend` and `resume`. Extra transitions in §14.2: `awaiting_creator_signature` can go to `changes_requested` (revoke) or `rejected` (expire).
* **Expiry and cleanup**: the `faxina das submissões` job every 6 h: `changes_requested` and `awaiting_creator_signature` submissions idle for more than 30 days become `rejected` and free the slug; ZIPs and folders of rejected ones disappear in 30 days; orphan folders and `.part` files in 1 day (`submissions/cleanup.ts`).
* **Migrations 0016 to 0018**, all additive: 0016 (tables, columns, an insert-only trigger on `package_reviews`, backfill of `creators.invited` and of the 6 published versions), 0017 (`attempts`) and 0018 (a trigger against `TRUNCATE` on `package_reviews`).
* **Extra routes**: `GET /api/creator/me`, `POST /api/creator/profile`, `GET /api/tx/publication/:submissionId`, `POST /api/tx/publication/confirm`, `GET /api/admin/submissions/:id/file` and `/knowledge-search`, `POST /api/creator/submissions?resubmit=<id>`. The upload body is raw `application/zip` (not multipart).
* **Telegram linked by the creator**: `POST /api/creator/telegram-link` + `/link` (alias `/vincular`) in the bot (migration 0019, additive); `cli:invite set-chat <wallet> <chatId>` remains as the admin shortcut (§14.1).
* **nginx**: the upload `limit_req_zone` ended up in the site file (`infra/nginx/solvers`, zone `solvers_upload`), not in the global `nginx.conf` (§14.4).
* **No `container` and no `http`**: `container` does not exist in v1; `http` and `mcp` are accepted by the manifest schema but **rejected for third parties** (`TOOL_FORBIDDEN_RUNNER`) and not executed. Third parties in the Core phase have no tool and no guarantee.
* **Rating**: the Registry stores a numeric `scoreBps` per `(agentId, versionHash)` (D6); only the labels changed (P5 partial). There is no `evalMethod` and no `platform_run`.
* **Kill switch with CLI**: `cli:suspend <slug> [--resume]` does `platform_status` and `suspendAgent` on-chain (closes DEF-22).
* **Publication**: `updateVersion` no longer zeroes anything (D6): a republished package keeps the ratings of its earlier versions and reads as "not measured for this version" until `setEval` runs for the new `versionHash` (§12.2, §15.3 step 3).

The Solver Builder (P2) can be used before P4: the creator sends you the ZIP and you publish it with today's `cli:publish` (on a test network, with creator keys the CLI generates under `CREATOR_KEYS_DIR`). That shortcut **does not apply to third parties, and the CLI refuses those keys on mainnet** (§15.2).

## 23. Minimal complete example (Core): "MEI Monthly Close"

MEI is Brazil's micro-entrepreneur tax regime (a simplified tax for very small businesses); DAS is the single monthly tax payment it involves. The example is Brazil-specific on purpose: it shows a package with live, dated, regulated-adjacent knowledge.

```
mei-monthly-close/
├─ manifest.json
├─ steps/01-collect-invoices.md  02-classify.md  03-generate-payment.md
├─ knowledge/das-mei-2026.md   revenue-limits.md   (with front matter)
├─ templates/monthly-report.md
└─ evals/cases/*.json   (10 cases)
```

```json
{
  "specVersion": 1,
  "slug": "mei-monthly-close",
  "name": "MEI Monthly Close",
  "tagline": "Close your MEI month with no mistakes: limit, DAS and report",
  "description": "Guides the AI through a monthly MEI close: it collects the month's revenue, checks the annual revenue limit, calculates the DAS with this year's amounts and delivers a report ready to file. The knowledge base brings the current rules and amounts with source and date. It does not do full accounting and does not file income tax returns.",
  "category": "Negócios",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "creator": { "id": "x", "name": "Simple Accounting", "bio": "Accountants who have served MEI businesses for 10 years" },
  "terms": { "rightsConfirmed": true, "sourcesListed": true },
  "requirements": [ { "type": "client", "label": "Claude or ChatGPT", "key": "any" } ],
  "packageContents": [
    "A 3-step method with a checklist",
    "A knowledge base with this year's DAS amounts and limits, with source and date",
    "A monthly report template",
    "Creator support for complex cases"
  ],
  "searchPhrases": ["close the month for my MEI", "how much DAS do I pay", "I'm close to the MEI limit"],
  "differentiators": ["liveData", "memory", "escalation"],
  "escalation": { "enabled": true },
  "usesMemory": true,

    { "file": "steps/02-classify.md", "gate": ["Year-to-date total and remaining limit calculated", "Month's DAS checked against the knowledge base with the source's date"] },
    { "file": "steps/03-generate-payment.md", "gate": ["Month's report delivered", "Reminder to double-check on the official portal"] }
  ],
  "knowledge": { "updatedAt": "2026-09-30", "reviewEveryDays": 90, "sources": ["Receita Federal", "Portal do Empreendedor"] },
  "templates": [ { "name": "monthly-report", "path": "templates/monthly-report.md", "title": "Monthly report", "description": "Revenue, limit and DAS for the month" } ],
  "onboarding": { "questions": [ { "id": "activity", "ask": "What is your MEI's activity: commerce, services or both?", "why": "The DAS amount changes depending on the activity", "options": ["Commerce", "Services", "Both"] } ] },
  "pricing": { "priceUsdc": 9, "royaltyBps": 0 },
  "trial": { "uses": 3, "steps": 2, "searches": 3, "tools": {}, "templates": [], "summary": "You get steps 1 and 2: the month's revenue, the remaining limit and the DAS checked against the knowledge base.", "lockedSummary": "The month's report and the ready-made template are in the full version." },
  "guarantee": { "available": false, "defaultCriteria": [] },
  "versions": [ { "version": "1.0.0", "releasedAt": "2026-09-30", "notes": "First version" } ]
}
```

Notes on the example: the `id` is absent because it is the 1st version (the server assigns it); `creator.id` is overwritten; `tagline` is 60 characters and `name` 17 bytes (within the limits); 3 declared differentiators, each with what the reviewer checks (§4.2): `updatedAt` within `reviewEveryDays` and no expired file; a step that uses the profile; a verified contact channel. No tool because third parties have no tools in the Core phase. The content is **tax-related** (category `Negócios`, allowed in the Core phase): it needs a disclaimer in the text, and step 3's gate provides for it ("Reminder to double-check on the official portal"). Without the front matter and the 3 steps, the package is not valid: the example shows the manifest, not the whole package. The `category` value stays in Portuguese because that is the identifier the validator accepts today.

Front matter of `knowledge/das-mei-2026.md`:

```yaml
---
title: DAS-MEI amounts in 2026
source: Receita Federal
source_url: https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/
source_date: 2026-01-15
valid_until: 2026-12-31
tags: [das, amounts]
---
```

**Usage flow**: the user connects the connector -> `activate_solver` -> `preflight_check` -> `get_memory` returns `needs_onboarding` -> the AI asks about the activity and saves the profile -> `next_step` delivers step 1 -> the AI asks for the revenue -> step 2 checks the DAS in the knowledge base (`search_knowledge`, with the source's date and a warning if expired) -> step 3 uses `get_template` to deliver the report -> if the user asks ("save that my MEI is services"), the AI stores a note.

**Opening-phase variant** (for reference only): the same package with an `http` tool (`calculate_limit`, numeric input and typed output, §8.3) and the gate `{ "text": "Limit calculated", "evidence": { "tool": "calculate_limit" } }` in step 2. In that variant, `trial.steps` must be >= 2 and `trial.tools` must unlock `calculate_limit`, otherwise the trial never runs the tool.

## Appendix A: Validation code catalog

`E` = error (blocks the submission), `A` = warning (goes to the reviewer). In **v0** (a platform package with no `specVersion`), the rules for new fields (`terms`, `evidence`, `source`, `versions`, step sections, case minimum) are all `A`; no `E` code for a new field applies to v0. Every code must have at least one test (P1).
